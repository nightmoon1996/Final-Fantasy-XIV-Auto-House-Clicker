the title said it all

You're going to need a python.

This script also required pyautogui to control the mouse. 

```
 pip install pyautogui
```

It would be best if you also found a way to lock the house buying window. I recommend SimpleTweaks that also going to require FFXIV Quick Launcher | Dalamud Plugins
